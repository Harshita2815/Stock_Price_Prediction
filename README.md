## Maruti Suzuki Stock Price Forecasting using ARIMA and CNN-LSTM

This project focuses on time series forecasting of Maruti Suzuki stock prices using both classical statistical methods (ARIMA) and a deep learning-based hybrid approach (1D CNN-LSTM). It includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

#### Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy â€” Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn â€” Data visualization

Statsmodels â€” ARIMA modeling

Scikit-learn â€” Evaluation metrics

TensorFlow / Keras â€” Deep learning (CNN-LSTM)

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Plotted OHLC, Volume, VWAP

Monthly & annual average prices

Visualized candlestick charts

Identified seasonality, trend, and volatility

Applied log transformation for stabilization of variance

#### ARIMA Modeling (Baseline):

STL decomposition used to analyze seasonal and trend components

Checked stationarity using ADF test

Applied differencing, and plotted ACF & PACF

Tried various models: ARIMA(0,1,0), ARIMA(1,1,0), ARIMA(0,1,1)

Selected model using AIC/BIC criteria

#### ARIMA Evaluation (Last 30 Business Days):

Forecasted stock prices for 30 days
